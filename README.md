# Anirudh Buvanesh (He/Him/His)
I am currently a Ph.D. student at Université dé Montréal and Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) where I am supervised by Prof. Aaron Courville and Prof. Laurent Charlin. 
Earlier, I was a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/)(MSRI) in the Extreme Classification group, where I was advised by [Dr. Manik Varma](http://manikvarma.org/).

Prior to joining Microsoft Research I worked at Salesforce as a software developer in the Consumer Goods Team.

I graduated from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2021 with a Master's degree in Mathematics and Bachelors degree in Computer Science. During that time I interned at CEERI, Amazon, Salesforce and TIFR.
